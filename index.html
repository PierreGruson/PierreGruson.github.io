        I love reading fantasy and SF books because it has a big background and it's really immersive.<br>

        When I was younger I played a lot of video games. I was playing MMORPG because you are choosing what you want to
        be and what you want to do.<br>

        I'm playing basketball since 8 years. It's my favorite sport. <br>
